A cross between an elephant and a pig.  It is known to be a very kind and loving creature except between 3am to 4pm.  At 3am the elepig becomes onery and a huge prankster.  It will hide random foods in your bed, put spiders in your ears, and remove liquids from bottles in your refrigerator to refill them with urine.
